        Instead of soliciting user input, we could also use a random number
        as an input to test. Very soon we will talk about better ways to
        generate *real* random numbers, but for now, we'll stick with a more
        brute force approach.

        Write a Python program that generates a "random-ish" number between
        1 and 100 **without using any imports**. (We will cover imports in
        Week3B).

        Your program should:

        1. Ask the user to type something unpredictable (letters, numbers, or a mix).
        2. Convert the user input into a number between 1 and 100 using a simple calculation (for example, using the length of the input).
        3. Print the generated number.
        4. Check if the number is smaller than 5.
           - If it is, print a message telling the user they have won a prize.
           - Otherwise, print a message saying there is no prize.

        **Example run:**
        ```
        Type something random: hello
        The generated number is: 5
        Sorry, no prize this time.
        ```

        Type something random: a
        The generated number is: 1
        Congratulations! You won a prize!
        ```

        **Hints:**
        - Use `len()` to get the length of the input.
        - Use arithmetic (`%`, `+`) to keep the number in the 1–100 range.
        - Use an `if/else` statement to check if the number is smaller than 5.

        `and`, and `or`. Using those operators.

        Write a Python program that asks the user to enter:
        - The number of cats
        - The number of dogs

        Then use **booleans** and the boolean relational operators (`==`,
        `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `not`, `and`, `or`) to compare the two
        values.

        Your program should print messages according to the following
        rules:

        1. If there is at least one cat, print `Squeee!`
        2. If there are 5 cats or more, print `Purr...`
        3. If there are 5 dogs or more, print `Arf!`
        4. If there are either more than 10 cats **or** more than 10 dogs, print `Where frends?`
        5. If there are more than 10 cats **and** more than 10 dogs, print `Frends!`
        6. If there are exactly as many cats as dogs, print `Perfection.`

        To get practice with more boolean logic, also add these extra checks:
        7. If the number of cats and dogs is **not equal**, print `Not balanced.`
        8. If there are fewer cats than dogs, print `More dogs than cats.`
        9. If there are at least twice as many cats as dogs, print `Cats rule!`
        10. If there are at least twice as many dogs as cats, print `Dogs rule!`
        11. If there are **no cats and no dogs** (zero of both), print `No pets at all!`

        **Example run:**
        ```
        Enter the number of cats: 12
        Enter the number of dogs: 12
        Squeee!
        Purr...
        Arf!
        Where frends?
        Frends!
        Perfection.
        ```

        **Requirements:**
        - Use at least **6 different boolean operators** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `not`, `and`, `or`) in your solution.
        - Each rule should be checked with an `if` statement (not `elif`), because more than one condition may be true.
