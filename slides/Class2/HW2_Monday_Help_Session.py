    # Homework 2 Help Session
    ## Problems 1-3: Strings and Lists

    **Goal:** Help you develop the problem-solving approach for tonight's homework

    **Duration:** 15 minutes

    **Structure:** For each technique, we'll:
    1. Think through the LOGIC together
    2. Write PSEUDOCODE in plain English
    3. CODE it in Python immediately

    **Make a copy** of this notebook so you can refer back to it later!

    ## The Four-Step Problem-Solving Framework

    For EVERY problem in your homework, use this approach:

    1. **What information do I have?** (Inputs/Given data)
    2. **What do I need to find?** (Outputs/Goals)
    3. **What are the steps to get from inputs to outputs?** (Algorithm)
    4. **How do I write those steps in Python?** (Code)

    Let's practice with simplified versions of your homework problems...

    # Technique 1: Splitting Strings and Accessing Parts

    ## Problem: Extract First, Middle, and Last Names

    **Given:**
    ```python
    fullName = "Jane Marie Smith"
    ```

    **Task:** Extract and print the first, middle, and last names separately

    ---

    ### 🤔 Let's Think Through This:

    **Question 1:** What tool do we have for breaking up strings by spaces?

    **Question 2:** Once we split the name, what do we get?

    **Question 3:** How do we access individual parts from a list?

    ---

    ### ✍️ Pseudocode:

    ```
    EXTRACTING NAMES:
    1. Split the full name by spaces → get a list of words
    2. Access index 0 → first name
    3. Access index 1 → middle name
    4. Access index 2 → last name
    5. Print each one
    ```

    # Technique 2: Splitting on Different Characters

    ## Problem: Extract Username from Email

    **Given:**
    ```python
    email = "jane.smith@university.edu"
    ```

    **Task:** Extract just the username (part before @)

    ---

    ### 🤔 Let's Think Through This:

    **Question 1:** What character separates the username from the domain?

    **Question 2:** Can we split on that character?

    **Question 3:** Which part do we want - before or after the @?

    ### ✍️ Pseudocode:

    EXTRACTING USERNAME:
    1. Split email by "@" → get list with 2 parts
    2. First part (index 0) = username
    3. Second part (index 1) = domain (we don't need this)
    4. Print username

    # Technique 3: Building Strings from Pieces

    ## Problem: Create Initials from Names

    **Given:**

    ## ✅ Remember for Tonight:

    1. **Always use the 4-step framework** - don't jump straight to code!
    2. **Write pseudocode first** - English before Python
    3. **Test frequently** - run your code after each small piece
    4. **Use good variable names** - `firstName` not `x`
    5. **Add comments** - explain your thinking
    6. **Problems 1-3 only use strings and lists** - no if/else needed!
