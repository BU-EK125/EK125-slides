# How to make changes to this site (a guide for instructors)

This guide walks through the whole process of editing a slide deck and getting your change published, assuming you've never used git or GitHub before. Follow the steps in order the first few times -- once it clicks, it takes about a minute of actual work per change (plus however long you spend actually editing slides).

**Before you start:** see the [README](README.md) for how this repo is structured -- it's a bit different from the other EK125 sites, since the interactive content is a [marimo](https://marimo.io) app embedded in each page, not a Jupyter notebook the site executes directly.

## One-time setup

You only need to do this once, ever, on a given computer.

1. **Install git.**
   - Mac: open Terminal and type `git --version`. If it's not installed, it'll prompt you to install it -- follow the prompt.
   - Windows: download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This also gives you "Git Bash," a terminal you'll use for the commands below.
2. **Install marimo** (to actually edit slide decks): `pip install marimo`.
3. **Get a GitHub account** if you don't have one already, at [github.com](https://github.com).
4. **Ask to be added as a collaborator** on `BU-EK125/EK125-slides` (whoever manages the repo can add your GitHub username under the repo's Settings → Collaborators). Without this, you won't be able to push changes.
5. **Download ("clone") the repo to your computer.** Open Terminal (or Git Bash on Windows), navigate to wherever you'd like the folder to live (e.g., `cd Documents`), then run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BU-EK125/EK125-slides.git
   ```
   This creates a folder called `EK125-slides` with a full copy of the repo. You only do this once -- from now on you'll just update this same folder.

## Every time you want to make a change

Think of this as a 5-step recipe: **update → branch → edit → commit/push → open a pull request.**

### 1. Make sure you're starting from the latest version

Open a terminal, move into the repo folder, and pull the latest changes:
```
cd EK125-slides
git checkout main
git pull
```

### 2. Create a new branch for your change

A "branch" is just an isolated workspace for one change, so your edits don't collide with anyone else's. Name it something short and descriptive:
```
git checkout -b update-class5-slides
```
(Replace `update-class5-slides` with whatever describes your change.)

### 3. Make your edit

To edit an existing deck, open it live in marimo's own editor:
```
marimo edit slides/Class2/Class2_Lecture.py
```
This opens marimo's UI in your browser, where you can edit cells and rearrange slides like normal. Save when you're done -- marimo saves directly back to the `.py` file.

**Adding a brand-new deck?** See the "To add a new deck" section in the [README](README.md) -- you'll also need a `_toc.yml` entry and the Colab-button config.

**One thing you do need to do yourself:** after editing a deck (new or existing), run `./build_slides.sh` from the repo root and include the resulting change to `notebooks/<DeckName>.ipynb` in your commit. That file is what the 🚀 Colab button on the live site opens -- it has to be a real, committed file, so it can't be generated automatically by CI the way the rest of the build is. If you forget, step 6's check will catch it and tell you to fix it.

### 4. Save your change to git ("commit") and upload it ("push")

Back in the terminal:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Update Class 5 slides"
git push -u origin update-class5-slides
```
- `git add .` stages every change you made.
- `git commit -m "..."` saves a snapshot with a short description -- replace the text in quotes with a plain-English summary of what you changed.
- `git push ...` uploads your branch to GitHub. The `-u origin update-class5-slides` part is only needed the very first time you push this branch; after that, plain `git push` works.

### 5. Open a pull request ("PR")

A pull request is a request to merge your branch into the live site. After you push, GitHub will print a URL in the terminal like:
```
remote: Create a pull request for 'update-class5-slides' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/BU-EK125/EK125-slides/pull/new/update-class5-slides
```
Open that link in your browser (or go to the repo on github.com -- it'll show a yellow banner offering to create the PR for your recently-pushed branch). Give it a title, optionally a description, and click **Create pull request**.

### 6. Wait for the automatic check, then merge

Every PR automatically runs a check called `pr-check` that exports every marimo deck, verifies `notebooks/` matches what you committed, and rebuilds the whole site -- this is where a deck that fails to export, or a forgotten `notebooks/` commit, gets caught. You'll see a status at the bottom of the PR page:
- 🟡 Yellow = still running, wait a few minutes.
- ✅ Green = passed. Click **Merge pull request**.
- ❌ Red = something's broken. Click "Details" next to the check to see what failed, fix it (edit the file, then repeat step 4 to push another commit to the same branch -- no need to open a new PR), and it'll re-run automatically.

Once merged, the live site rebuilds and republishes automatically within a few minutes -- no further action needed.

## Cheat sheet

Once you're comfortable, this is the whole thing:
```
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b my-branch-name
marimo edit slides/ClassN/DeckName.py   # ...edit, save, close...
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push -u origin my-branch-name
# ...open the PR link GitHub gives you, wait for the green check, click Merge...
```

## Common hiccups

- **"Permission denied" / "403" when pushing:** you're probably not yet added as a collaborator on the repo (see step 4 of setup), or you're not signed into git with the right GitHub account. Try `git config --global user.email` to check which email git thinks you are.
- **"Your branch is behind" or a merge conflict:** someone else's change landed on `main` before yours. Run `git checkout main && git pull`, then from your branch run `git merge main` and resolve any conflicts it flags (or just ask for help -- conflicts are the one part of git that's genuinely easier with a second pair of eyes).
- **The check failed on your deck:** click "Details" on the failed check to see the export error. This usually means a cell errors when marimo tries to run it -- open the deck with `marimo edit` and check that every cell runs cleanly top to bottom.
- **Not sure if your change is safe to make directly, or you'd like someone to look before it goes live:** that's exactly what the pull request is for -- it doesn't touch the live site until someone clicks "Merge." Feel free to open it and ask a question in the PR description rather than merging right away.
